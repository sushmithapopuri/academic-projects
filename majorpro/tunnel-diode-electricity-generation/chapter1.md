# STUDY OF TUNNEL DIODE

**1.1 Introduction**

Tunnel diode was first invented in 1957 by Leo Esaki in Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, the parent organization of Sony. As a tribute to its inventor, it is also called Esaki Diode. It has a special feature of exhibiting tunneling effect which draws more focus than other negative resistance devices. Due to this interesting property, its inventor was honored with a Nobel Prize in physics in 1973.

**1.2 Difference from Normal P-N Diode**

The construction of tunnel diode is similar to that of a normal P-N Diode. The main difference arise with the doping concentrations of diode. The semiconductor wafer is heavily doped with acceptor and donor concentrations such that the reverse breakdown voltage is at zero. Due to such heavy doping levels, the forward bias operation paves way for a unique characteristic property of tunneling.

**1.3 Negative Resistance**

Any semiconductor device with a peculiar property of adopting inverse ohms law is called a negative resistance device. They are bidirectional in nature. These devices are capable of replacing the active devices of a circuit.

The concept of negative resistance can be discussed as follows. Ohms law is given by

Where I is the current flowing into the passive element, R is the resistance offered by the element and V is potential difference applied across the terminals of the element. This law is suitable to all the conductors. But in case of semiconductors, this law is violated due to dependence of their conductivity on temperature. Due to their variable conductivity, there has been significant difference in the properties they show with reference to conductors. Their property of voltage difference generation due to flow of current in opposite direction helped make a new area of research to fight energy crisis.

**1.4 Concept of tunneling**

The origin or base theory of tunneling effect is the fact of existence of quantum mechanical particle. According to quantum theory an electron penetrates into any potential barrier for some distance, similar to the way light slightly penetrates an opaque metal surface. As a consequence of this wave penetration property, if a potential barrier is thin relative to the electronâ€™s Bloch wavelength, the particle can sometimes slip freely though the barrier without paying the energy costs to surmount it.

In the original tunnel diode, the barrier though which tunneling occurs is the space-charge, depletion region of a p-n junction. At the heterojunction, a potential-energy discontinuity results, creating an abrupt potential barrier. This ghostlike passage through a barrier is referred to as tunneling.

**1.5 Characteristics of tunnel diode**

The reason for this is that there are a number of different components which form the overall curve.

* _**Normal diode current:**_ This is the 'normal' current that would flow through a PN junction diode.

The different current contributions or components that make up the overall current passed by the tunnel diode

**Figure 1.3 Tunnel diode current components**

* _**Excess current:**_ This is a third element of current that contributes to the overall current within the diode. It results from what may be termed excess current that results from tunneling though bulk states in the energy gap, and means that the valley current does not fall to zero.
* _**Tunneling current:**_ This is the current that arises as a result of the tunneling effect.

All these currents add up to give the I-V Characteristics of tunnel diode. The peak value is observed at Vp and the transition from negative resistance region to linear region is done at Valley point Vv.
