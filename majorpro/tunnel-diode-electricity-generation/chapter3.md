**Figure 1.1 Circuit design for using Tunnel Diode as a supply Source**

The circuit has a series of tunnel diodes connected to a resonant circuit. The diodes are operated in negative resistance region where in the flow of current is from tunnel diode to the reactive zone of the circuit. The negative resistance has a range of -80 to -180 which is fairly large. The slightest increase in the potential applied between the two terminals will result in the movement of operating point which is lying in the unstable region (negative resistance region) to extreme and stable D.C operating points which lie in the positive resistance regions

Whenever there is an increase in surrounding temperature, the electrons get excited and flow of current begins. Since negative resistance delivers current instead of consuming it. Thus power is delivered to remaining elements of the circuit. The other passive elements in the circuit are designed in such a way that they cancel the negative resistance of the diode.

**3.2 Analysis of the Circuit**

The tunnel diode equivalence circuit in the negative resistance region is provided the inductor a less is due to the terminal leads. The resister Rs is due to the leads, the ohmic contact at the lead semiconductor junction and the semiconductor materials themselves. The capacitance C is the junction diffusion capacity, and the R is the negative resistance of the region. Top of Form

**Figure 3.3 Small Signal Model of Tunnel Diode**

The slightest change in temperature excites electrons to be moved from n- doped semiconductor to p- doped semiconductor. The resistance reduces as a consequence of negative resistance effect and thus the frequency dependent elements like junction capacitance, diffusion capacitance etc., become more significant.

As these elements do not feed on D.C Current, the direct current flows out of tunnel diode. The external circuit is designed in such a way that it by passes the resistive role played by the copper connecting leads paving way to charging up the battery.
