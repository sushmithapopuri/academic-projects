# OPERATION OF TUNNEL DIODE

The piece wise analysis of the characteristic curve of tunnel diode is done in order to study the operation of tunnel diode operating at various voltage levels. This study helps in analyzing the behavior of tunnel diode in different conditions. The behavior of tunnel diode is studied under different conditions.

**2.1 No Bias Condition**

**Fig 2.1 Characteristic curve in No Bias Condition**

In the initial stage, when no external biasing is done, the diode is in dormant state where there exists no flow of current.

**2.2 Forward Bias Condition**

In the depletion region, an increase in terminal voltage results in a diode current. The tunnel diode is fabricated by doping the semiconductor materials that will form the p-n junction at a level 100 to several thousand times that of a typical semiconductor diode. This results in a greatly reduced depletion region of the order of magnitude of 10-6 cm, or typically about 0.01 the width of this region for a typical semiconductor diode.

**Figure 2.2 Characteristic curve with applied voltage Equal to Threshold Voltage**

It is this thin depletion region through which many carriers can tunnel rather than attempt to surmount at low forward bias potential that account for the peak in the curve. This reduced depletion region results in carriers punching thorough at velocities that exceed dose available with conventional diodes. As a result there is an acceleration in the current growth rate even when there is a steady growth rate of voltage until the peak value is reached.

**Figure 2.3 Applied Voltage Slightly Greater Than Threshold Value**

The valley voltage is fairly constant at about 0.13V, which is significantly less than the typical turn-on voltage for a silicon diode. Whenever the applied voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, there is an increased collision rate in electron which tend to influence the electrons to gain sufficient energy easily to cross the barrier. As a result, the current increases exponentially and reaches maximum.

**Figure 2.4 Applied Voltage Significantly Greater Than Threshold Value( Charge Exhausts)**

As the current increases, the number of charge carriers keep on reducing. Once the current reaches its maximum, the free charge carriers are minimum. So even though the voltage goes on increasing, charge exhaust leads to decrease in the current.

**Figure 2.6 Operation As A Normal P-N Diode at higher Voltages**

As a result of excess carrier flow, the unpaired donor and acceptor ions which are produced recombine leading to increase in width of depletion region. Due to increased width of depletion region, tunnel diode now operates as a normal P-N Diode.

**2.3 Reverse Bias Condition**

The operation of tunnel diode is same as that that of a normal P-N Diode in reverse bias condition as the width of depletion region increases due to recombination. The only difference is that the breakdown voltage is at 0 only. So a non-zero rate of current growth starts at 0.
