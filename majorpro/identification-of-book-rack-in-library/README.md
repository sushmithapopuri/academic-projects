# IDENTIFICATION OF A BOOK RACK IN A LIBRARY

This project helps in identification of racks in a library with the help of lights. More precisely, this project goes on with a identification number of a book as input to a microcontroller which has to send a activating signal to the relays to help the corresponding bulb glow.

Each book has a unique id number and each rack has a finite defined set of numbers associated with it. Upon inputting the identification number of a book to the microcontroller, a signal should be sent to the output unit. The output unit consists of relays which control bulbs fixed at different racks. The signal sent from the controller acts as selecting signal which selects the bulb which is attached to the rack containing the required book.

**Salient features of this project:**

* This project can be implemented in huge libraries where location of a particular book is highly difficult amidst thousands of books.
* The location of the book is presented as glowing of bulb which is easier to detect and has more impact on the user than the existing library information systems which give the same data in the form of rack numbers.
* This system is useful not only in locating a book but also in replacing the book back.
* This system does not require much power as it does not make the bulbs glow continuously for a long time.

This project finds its applications in many other domains like in the documentation section of various companies/organizations where a lot of stuff is frequently used and has to be replaced simultaneously for further use. The scope of this project not only is limited to documentation but also extends to other domains where one item is to be searched amongst a group of similar items with each item bearing a unique id.

**Requirements:**

**Hardware:** Microcontroller-AT89C51, SPDT Relays-5, Bulbs-5, Other Components

**Software:** Keil Software
