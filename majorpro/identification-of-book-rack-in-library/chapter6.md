# FUTURE WORK

**6.1 Challenges**

* For huge Libraries, Database integration is required as it becomes a difficult task to memorize the ID numbers.
* As the number of racks increase, complexity increases as the number of relays to be interfaced increase.
* It can be used by only 1 user at a time.

These shortcomings are to be rectified which is planned as a part of future scope.

**6.2 Future Scope**

&#x20;The scope of this project not only is limited to documentation but also extends to other domains where one item is to be searched amongst a group of similar items with each item bearing a unique id. To extend the range of usage, more number of relays are to be interfaced. So there should be expansion slots for I/O interfacing. Along with that, in order to have large number of relays interfaced memory storage is required. To improve efficiency, advanced microcontrollers are to be used.
