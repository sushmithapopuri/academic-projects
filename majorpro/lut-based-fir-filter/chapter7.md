# ADVANTAGES AND APPLICATIONS

The analysis of the applicability of the project is done. The proposed project has certain advantages and disadvantages. Upon considering the advantages and overcoming the disadvantages, the future scope of the project is estimated.

**7.1 Salient Features of the project**

The main advantages of digital are listed as follows:

1. The design, testing and implementation of digital filters is flexible
2. These filters are easily upgradable and so reusability of hardware is possible.
3. Since the circuitry is built up using digital components, the circuits are more resistive to surroundings and their characteristics are extremely stable.
4. These filters show a versatility in their ability to handle signals in all possible ways.
5. They adapt in accordance with the signal characteristics.
6. Low frequency signals can also be dealt with.
7. The increasing speeds of DSP technology paves way for working with signals of RF range.
8. Parallel computations that take place in DSPs make the possibility of realization of filters in series or parallel or cascaded.

Due to its salient features, this project finds its usage in a versatility of domains like wireless communication infrastructure, high speed computation structures, monotonous observers etc.

**7.2 Applications**

This project finds its applications in many domains where filter is required. The concept of reduction in memory is applied whenever there is huge and significant growth in the demand. Some areas of applicability include:

* Rapid rate calculators
* Super computers
* Moving average estimators

Although there are many applications for this project, there are certain short comings as well which limits its applicability. These have to be overcome to expand the project and extend its range of applicability.
